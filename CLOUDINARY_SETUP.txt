CLOUDINARY SETUP GUIDE FOR ABZ HARDWARE ADMIN PORTAL
====================================================

Your ABZ Hardware admin portal has been successfully integrated with Cloudinary for cloud-based image storage!

WHAT'S BEEN IMPLEMENTED:
- Cloudinary SDK installed and configured
- Image upload functions updated to use Cloudinary
- Image deletion functions updated to clean up Cloudinary storage
- Configuration file created for easy credential management
- Templates already support Cloudinary URLs
- Environment variable support added for security

SETUP STEPS:
============

1. CREATE CLOUDINARY ACCOUNT:
   - Go to https://cloudinary.com/
   - Sign up for a free account
   - Verify your email

2. GET YOUR CREDENTIALS:
   - Log into Cloudinary dashboard
   - Go to "Dashboard" section
   - Copy your:
     * Cloud Name
     * API Key  
     * API Secret

3. CONFIGURE CREDENTIALS (Choose one method):

   METHOD A - Environment Variables (Recommended for Production):
   - Create a file named ".env" in your project root
   - Add your credentials:
     CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_actual_cloud_name
     CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
     CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_actual_api_secret

   METHOD B - Direct Configuration (For Development):
   - Edit config.py file and replace placeholder values:
     CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = 'your_actual_cloud_name'
     CLOUDINARY_API_KEY = 'your_actual_api_key'
     CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET = 'your_actual_api_secret'

4. TEST THE INTEGRATION:
   - Start your Flask app
   - Go to Products page
   - Try adding a new product with an image
   - The image should upload to Cloudinary and display

FEATURES:
=========
- Automatic image optimization (max 800x800px)
- Images stored in 'abz_products' folder
- Secure HTTPS URLs
- Automatic cleanup of old images
- Error handling for upload failures
- Support for PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF files
- Environment variable support for secure credential management

BENEFITS:
=========
- No server storage limitations
- Global CDN for fast image loading
- Automatic image optimization
- Secure and reliable storage
- Free tier: 25GB storage + 25GB bandwidth

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================
- If images don't upload: Check your Cloudinary credentials
- If images don't display: Verify the URL is accessible
- For upload errors: Check file size (max 16MB) and format
- If using .env file: Make sure it's in the project root directory

SECURITY NOTES:
==============
- Never commit real credentials to version control
- Use environment variables (.env file) for production
- Add .env to your .gitignore file
- Cloudinary URLs are secure HTTPS by default

FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:
======================
- config.py: Configuration with Cloudinary settings
- main.py: Updated with Cloudinary upload/delete functions
- CLOUDINARY_SETUP.txt: This setup guide
- .env: Create this file with your credentials (not tracked by git)

The integration is complete and ready to use!
